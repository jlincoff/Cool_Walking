# Cool_Walking

Cool Walking (CW) is an enhanced sampling method originally developed in 2002: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.10181/abstract (Brown, Head-Gordon. JCC 24, 2002). This package contains codes for applying CW methods to peptides, as described in (JCP paper). It also includes codes for standard replica exchange (REx) simulations, against which CW was compared. There are two versions of each method: one that modifies the system temperature (TCW, TREx), and one that modifies the dielectric constant (by scaling of the charges) of the peptide (DCW, CREx). 

CW achieves equivalent or greater rates of convergence to the equilibrium distribution in comparison to REx, for greatly decreased cost. This is primarily because CW fully simulates only two replicas, as opposed to the dozens used in REx, and then applies a statistical annealing or cooling procedure during exchange attempts to maintain high acceptance ratios. For example, 100 ns of data at the temperature of interest for amyloid-beta 42 solvated in 7,600 Tip4Ew waters can be generated by TCW using roughly 13 % the total propagation that would be used for an equivalent TREx simulation, and that data will be better-converged than the TREx data.

Initial testing is set up for alanine dipeptide.
